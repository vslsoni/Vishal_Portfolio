# <ins>[Project 1: ETL Process and Data Analysis for Sell Phone Company](https://github.com/vslsoni/SQL-Sales-Project-Snowflake)</ins>
## Project Overview
This project focuses on extracting, transforming, and loading (ETL) sales order data from three major regions: **Asia (India), Europe (France), and North America (USA)**. The objective was to harmonise this data into a unified structure using **Snowflake** and **SQL**, ensuring accurate and insightful data analysis through dynamic dashboards.

## Objectives
- Integrate sales order data from multiple regions into a single structured format.
- Utilize **Snowflake** as the primary data warehouse for storage and processing.
- Automate data ingestion and transformation to streamline the ETL process.
- Develop interactive dashboards for data visualization and analysis.

# <ins>[Project 2: Retail Sales Prediction using predictive modelling](https://github.com/vslsoni/Python-sales-predictive-modelling)</ins>
## Project Overview
This project focuses on building and evaluating predictive models for forecasting **sales in Rossmann drug stores**. Given historical sales data and various influencing factors such as promotions, competition, holidays, and store attributes, the goal is to develop a robust predictive model. The best-performing model is integrated into a **Gradio-based interface**, allowing users to input store features and obtain sales predictions.
Rossmann operates over **3,000 stores** across **7 European countries**. Store managers manually predict daily sales weeks in advance, leading to inconsistencies in accuracy. This project aims to automate and improve sales forecasting using **machine learning models** trained on historical sales data for **1,115 stores**.
